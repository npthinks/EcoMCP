# EcoMCP

**EcoMCP** is an eco-intelligent MCP (Model Context Protocol) agent designed to provide **carbon footprint insights for Indian foods**. It combines a FastAPI backend with MCP integration to allow AI systems or other clients to query carbon footprint data efficiently.

---

## üöÄ Features

* Query carbon footprint data by **food name**, **region**, or **food ID**.
* Supports **partial matches** for food names.
* Handles **single and combination of regions**.
* MCP integration using **FastMCP** and **stdio transport**.
* API hosted locally using **FastAPI**.

## üß© Architecture Overview

* **Transport:** `stdio`
* **API Host:** Localhost (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
* **MCP Host:** Perplexity
* **MCP Client:** FastMCP (handles requests and communicates with FastAPI)
* **MCP Server:** FastAPI-based backend providing carbon footprint data

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The project uses a curated Indian Food Carbon Footprint dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on carbon footprints for various Indian foods along with their region(s) of origin.

**Dataset Pre-Processing**

Region Normalization: Multiple regions listed for a single food item were standardized into a consistent, alphabetically sorted, comma-separated format.
Unique ID Assignment: Each food item was assigned a unique identifier based on its region combination and order within that group.
Format: The dataset is stored in JSON format, with each record containing:

**Key Columns**
* ID ‚Üí Unique identifier for the food item
* Food ‚Üí Name of the food item
* Region ‚Üí Single or combination of regions (e.g., "North, West")
* Category ‚Üí Food type (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg)
* Serving ‚Üí Standard serving size
* Carbon Footprint(kg CO2e) ‚Üí Emissions in kg CO‚ÇÇ per kg of food

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11**
* **FastAPI** (Backend API)
* **FastMCP** (MCP client integration)
* **Transport:** stdio
* **Cursor IDE** for development
